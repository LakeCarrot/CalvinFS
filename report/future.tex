\section{Ongoing and future works}
Figuring out how to do the remastering operation itself is just the first step, we also need to figure out when and where to do it. This requires designing a \textbf{deadlock resolution strategy} to enable arbitrary direction of remastering,  a \textbf{profiling tools} to capture the file access pattern and a \textbf{learning algorithm} to discover underlying correlation between different files. We plan to keep track of this project and work with Kun to finish this part afterwards.
