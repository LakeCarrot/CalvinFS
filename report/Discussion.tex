\section{Discussion}
In this section, we will discuss whether our protocol works under more tricky cases.
\subsection{Concurrent Remastering}
In previous section, we discussed the simplest case - a single remaster operation. Here, we will consider what if there are multiple concurrent remastering operations in the system. 
We have reroute mechanism to avoid falsely sent actions being ignored.

\subsection{Overlapping Remaster operation}
Only send remaster transaction once.


\subsection{Fail-over}
