\note{blue}{Hereby we first give an overview of our system}

\subsection{System Components}
\note{blue}{Draw a system architecture figure, and give detailed explanation about the system. Show that we completely understand the CalvinFS system, which is a non-negligible workload.}


\subsection{Remaster Protocol}
\note{blue}{Draw a figure to show the sequence of event during a Remaster operation. And in this subsection, we use a simple example to show how we deal with the simpliest case -- a single remaster operation}
