----------------------This is CalvinFS codebase.---------------------------

Installation(This is for Ubuntu 14.04, it should be similar with other Linux distribution):
1. You should install the following softwares:
   Git
   make,g++
   autoconf, libtool,libreadline-dev,libsnappy-dev
   subversion
   unzip, tar
   cmake


2. You should install the following external libraries:
    --- protobuf
    --- gtest
    --- glog
    --- leveldb
    --- zeromq
    --- gperftools
    --- gflags

   I wrote a script(install-ext), so that you can directly run this script to download the libraries and compile them.
